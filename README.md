# MNIST Digit Recognition with CNN

This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. Our model is implemented using PyTorch, a popular deep learning library.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of CNNs and how they can be applied to image recognition tasks. Throughout this project, we explored the following key concepts:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Utilizing PyTorch's `torchvision` package to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset. The dataset is transformed into tensors using the `ToTensor` method for easier manipulation in PyTorch.

- **Batch Processing**: Implementing batch processing of the dataset using PyTorch's `DataLoader`. This approach is essential for efficient training of neural networks on large datasets.

- **CNN Architecture**: Designing a CNN architecture suitable for digit recognition. Our model includes convolutional layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers to learn from the image data.

- **Training and Testing**: Setting up a training loop to train the model on the MNIST training dataset and evaluating its performance on a separate test dataset.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model designed for this project consists of the following layers:

- Two convolutional layers for feature extraction from images.
- A dropout layer to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units from the neural network during training.
- Fully connected layers to classify the images into the corresponding digit categories.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
